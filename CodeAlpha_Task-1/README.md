Titanic Survival Prediction - CodeAlpha Task

Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived the tragic sinking or not, based on a set of features available from historical data. This classification task is a common introductory problem in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning, providing a practical application for various data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling techniques.

Objectives
- Data Exploration: Understand the dataset, identify important features, and analyze patterns that may influence survival.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, convert categorical variables, and standardize numerical features.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features that might enhance the model's predictive power.
- Model Building: Implement and compare different machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.
- Prediction: Generate predictions on the test dataset and interpret the results.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic passenger data, which includes information such as:
- PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
- Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- Name: Name of the passenger.
- Sex: Gender of the passenger.
- Age: Age of the passenger.
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- Ticket: Ticket number.
- Fare: Passenger fare.
- Cabin: Cabin number.
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualize the distribution of variables.
   - Identify correlations and relationships between features and survival.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values using techniques like imputation.
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical using encoding methods.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features such as FamilySize, IsAlone, Title (extracted from the Name), etc.
   - Analyze the importance of each feature.

4. Modeling:
   - Train various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting.
   - Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

5. Evaluation:
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the results.

6. Prediction:
   - Use the best-performing model to make predictions on the test dataset.
   - Analyze the prediction results and draw conclusions.

Tools and Technologies
- Python: Programming language used for implementation.
- Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for developing and sharing code.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to a classic problem. By following a systematic approach from data exploration to model evaluation, it provides insights into the factors that influenced the survival of passengers on the Titanic and showcases the process of building predictive models to solve real-world problems.
