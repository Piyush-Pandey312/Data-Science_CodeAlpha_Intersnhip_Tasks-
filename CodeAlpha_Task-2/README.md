<p align="center"> Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict the stock prices of a chosen company using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It is a practical demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to real-world financial data. </p>

<!-- About the project -->
## About the Project ðŸ’»

Predicting stock prices is a challenging and exciting task due to the market's inherent volatility and the many factors influencing price movements. LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are well-suited for time series prediction due to their ability to remember previous inputs and capture temporal dependencies.

Key components of this project include:

- Data collection and preprocessing.
- Building and training an LSTM model.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.
- Making future stock price predictions.

## Project Workflow 

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection and Overview:** 
    - In this initial step, we gather the stock data of a chosen company using the Yahoo Finance API. We load and inspect the dataset to get a high-level understanding of its structure and content.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** 
    - Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing the dataset for modeling. This step involves normalizing the stock prices and formatting the data to fit the LSTM input requirements, ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis and modeling.

3. **Model Building:** 
    - We construct an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture includes LSTM layers followed by dense layers to make stock price predictions.

4. **Model Training:** 
    - With the preprocessed dataset, we compile and train the model. This involves defining key parameters like the learning rate and the number of epochs, and fitting the model to our data.

5. **Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:** 
    - We assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This evaluation helps in understanding the accuracy of our predictions.

6. **Prediction:** 
    - The trained model is used to predict future stock prices. These predictions are then compared with actual stock prices to evaluate the model's accuracy and reliability.

7. **Conclusion and Results:** 
    - In the final step, we summarize the results of our predictions. We provide insights into the model's performance, discuss the strengths and weaknesses, and suggest potential improvements for future work.

I want to express my appreciation to the open-source community for providing the tools and libraries that made this project possible. Special thanks to CodeAlpha for offering this internship opportunity and guidance.
